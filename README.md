## 📂 Signature Case Studies

### **1. SmartCash AI: Predictive Treasury & Liquidity Orchestration**
* **The Problem:** Corporate treasurers lack real-time visibility into multi-currency liquidity and often face fragmented bank-to-ledger reconciliation.
* **The Solution:** An AI-driven command center utilizing Python and GenAI to match bank feeds with open receivables, featuring a 3-year "Stress-Tested" liquidity forecast.
* **The Result:** Enabled 60% faster cash application and automated ESG-based risk profiling for global debtors.
